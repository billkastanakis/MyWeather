A Simple Forecast App

Execution Time: 5 hours.

The app fetches the weather forecast from open OpenWeatherMap API. I have used some simple animations just for demonstration. 

Features:
- Seamless transitions
- Created for 3.5 and 4 inch devices
- Asynchronous operation
- Animated interface

The app could be created with much less lines, by simply fetching the JSON and using key value instead of creating a model, endpoint and helper classes. Instead I simply followed some basic rules for better scalability like:

- Separate classes for each endopoint. Better organization in case of multiple verbs in the endpoint (BKOpenWeatherForecastEndpoint).
- Helper classes for JSON parsing and other convenient methods (BKWeatherHelper)
- Model Classes to follow MVC design pattern (BKForecast)

TO DO:
- some better error handling in case of no connection.
- implement caching for offline browsing if there is no connection.
- add some weather icons
- unit testing
